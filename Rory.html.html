        <h1><u>Futre Plans</h1></u>
        <p>"This is not a quick concept, this is a long-term agreement." Carla Murphy and her comrades-in-arms are serious. To that end, they have developed the "Three-Loop Strategy," the three building blocks to guarantee product sustainability in the future:
        <ul type="square>"
            <li>Recycled Loop (replace new plastic with recycled plastic.</li>
           
    </div>
    <div id="box2-div">
        <img src = "Image 2.jpg" width = "350" height = "250">
        <h1><u>Promising Statistics</h1></u>
        <p>The sporting goods giant Adidas has set itself ambitious goals. From 2024, only recycled plastic will be used, and by 2050 all production is to be climate-neutral. The company's own plan is characterized by the "three-loop strategy", with which partner Parley also helps, but also the promotion of a sustainable lifestyle among customers.</p>
